The evening tide surges around my leaden eyes

Float away it whispers
Do not fight.
Abyssal darkness awaits us all.
Your dream of life means nothing to the ocean deep

And I dream, kick and gasp for air. 
Take me when you take me
Or when I dive.
But not this tide.
The moon will pull you back. 
And I will spend another day
Laughing
Languid
In sunlit protean pools.
