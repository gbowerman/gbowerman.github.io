# Notes on Kubla Khan by Coleridge
This is a work in progress line by line study of _Kubla Khan (Or, a vision in a dream, A Fragment)_ by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 

Note: I am not working through this in a linear fashion, so as long as these notes are a work in progress, analysis will not start at the beginning of the poem.

## Stanza 1
_In Xanadu did Kubla Khan_
_A stately pleasure dome decreee:_
_Where Alph, the sacred river, ran_
_Through caverns measureless to man_
_Down to a sunless sea._

Here, with alliterative pairs on each line, we are introduced to a harmonious world. Stately, sacred, measureless. The pleasure dome as cathedral. The sacred river, believed to be a reference to the Greek river Alpheus, connected with sun-worship.

The _caverns measureless to man_ hint at a limitless unconscious. The _sunless sea_ indicates a deep, calm emotional state, perhaps too calm, death .

_So twice five miles of sacred ground_
_With walls and towers were girdled round;_
_And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,_
_Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;_
_And here were forests ancient as the hills,_
_Enfolding sunny spots of greenery._

The walled and towered gardens indicate beauty under control. We are led through an ancient and peaceful paradise. 

## Stanza 2
_But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted_
_Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover_
_A savage place! as holy and enchanted_
_As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted_
_By woman wailing for her demon-lover!_

_And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,_
_As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,_
_A mighty fountain momently was forced:_

_Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst_
_Huge fragments vaulted like reobounding hail,_
_Or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail:_

_And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever_
_It flung up momently the sacred river._
_Five miles meandering with a mazy motion_
_Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,_
_And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;_

_And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far_
_Ancestral voices prophersying war!_

## Stanza 3
_The shadow of the dome of pleasure_
_Floated midway on the waves;_
_Where was heard the mingled measure_
_From the fountain and the caves._
_It was a miracle of rare device,_
_A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!_

_A damsel with a dulcimer_
_In a vision once I saw:_
_It was an Abyssinian maid_
_And on her dulcimer she played,_
_Singing of Mount Abora._
_Could I revive within me_
_Her symphony and song,_
_To such a deep delight 'twould win me,_
_That with music loud and long,_
_I would build that dome in air,_
_That sunny dome! those caves of ice!_
_And all who heard should see them there,_
_And all should cry, Beware! Beware!_
_His flashing eyes, his floating hair!_
_Weave a circle round him thrice,_
_And close your eyes with holy dread_
_For he on honey-dew hath fed,_
_And dunk the milk of Paradise._
