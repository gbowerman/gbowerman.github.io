This is a work in progress line by line study of _Kubla Khan (Or, a vision in a dream, A Fragment)_ by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 

## Stanza 1
Sentiment 91%

__In Xanadu did Kubla Khan__  
__A stately pleasure dome decreee:__  
__Where Alph, the sacred river, ran__  
__Through caverns measureless to man__  
__Down to a sunless sea.__  

Here, with alliterative pairs on each line, we are introduced to a harmonious world. Stately, sacred, measureless. The pleasure dome as cathedral. The sacred river, believed to be a reference to the Greek river Alpheus, connected with sun-worship.

The _caverns measureless to man_ hint at a limitless unconscious. The _sunless sea_ indicates a deep, calm emotional state, perhaps too calm, death .

__So twice five miles of sacred ground__  
__With walls and towers were girdled round;__  
__And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,__  
__Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;__  
__And here were forests ancient as the hills,__  
__Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.__  

The walled and towered gardens indicate beauty under control. We are led through an ancient and peaceful paradise. Man and nature in sacred harmony.

## Stanza 2
Sentiment: 88%

The peace and harmony changes to passion and dynamism in the second stanza..

__But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted__  
__Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!__  
__A savage place! as holy and enchanted__  
__As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted__  
__By woman wailing for her demon-lover!__  

Sexual, passionate, intense. The depths of longing and emotion.

__And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,__  
__As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,__  
__A mighty fountain momently was forced:__  
__Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst__  
__Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,__  
__Or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail:__  

The dynamism reaches its turbulent climax. 

__And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever__  

At once and ever - here is the panta rhei of Heraclitus. Permament movement and renewal.

__It flung up momently the sacred river.__  
__Five miles meandering with a mazy motion__  
__Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,__  

The poem attains an alliterative apex, and revives the peaceful river. Reminding us of its divinity, evoking a calm day in the countryside.

__And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;__  

The sunless sea, now a lifeless ocean. Reminding us of the end point of turbulent birth and meandering life: death.

__And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far__  
__Ancestral voices prophesying war!__  

Here the poem takes on a more mystical tone, voices of ancestors, prophesy, oncoming war - possibly a reference to the revolt of Nayan in 1287.

__The shadow of the dome of pleasure__  
__Floated midway on the waves;__  
__Where was heard the mingled measure__  
__From the fountain and the caves.__  
__It was a miracle of rare device,__  
__A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!__  

__A damsel with a dulcimer__  
__In a vision once I saw:__  
__It was an Abyssinian maid__  
__And on her dulcimer she played,__  
__Singing of Mount Abora.__  
__Could I revive within me__  
__Her symphony and song,__  
__To such a deep delight 'twould win me,__  
__That with music loud and long,__  
__I would build that dome in air,__  
__That sunny dome! those caves of ice!__  
__And all who heard should see them there,__  
__And all should cry, Beware! Beware!__  
__His flashing eyes, his floating hair!__  
__Weave a circle round him thrice,__  
__And close your eyes with holy dread__  
__For he on honey-dew hath fed,__  
__And dunk the milk of Paradise.__
