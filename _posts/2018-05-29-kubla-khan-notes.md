title: "Notes on Kubla Khan by Coleridge"

This is a work in progress line by line study of _Kubla Khan (Or, a vision in a dream, A Fragment)_ by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 

Note: I am not working through this in a linear fashion, so as long as these notes are a work in progress, analysis will not start at the beginning of the poem.

## Stanza 1
__In Xanadu did Kubla Khan__  
__A stately pleasure dome decreee:__  
__Where Alph, the sacred river, ran__  
__Through caverns measureless to man__  
__Down to a sunless sea.__  

Here, with alliterative pairs on each line, we are introduced to a harmonious world. Stately, sacred, measureless. The pleasure dome as cathedral. The sacred river, believed to be a reference to the Greek river Alpheus, connected with sun-worship.

The _caverns measureless to man_ hint at a limitless unconscious. The _sunless sea_ indicates a deep, calm emotional state, perhaps too calm, death .

__So twice five miles of sacred ground__  
__With walls and towers were girdled round;__  
__And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,__  
__Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;__  
__And here were forests ancient as the hills,__  
__Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.__  

The walled and towered gardens indicate beauty under control. We are led through an ancient and peaceful paradise. Man and nature in sacred harmony.

## Stanza 2

The peace and harmony changes to passion and dynamism in the second stanza..

__But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted__  
__Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!__  
__A savage place! as holy and enchanted__  
__As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted__  
__By woman wailing for her demon-lover!__  

Sexual, passionate, intense. The depths of longing and emotion.

__And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,__  
__As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,__  
__A mighty fountain momently was forced:__  
__Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst__  
__Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,__  
__Or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail:__  

The dynamism reaches its turbulent climax. 

__And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever__  
__It flung up momently the sacred river.__  

At once and ever - here is the panta rhei of Heraclitus. Permament movement and renewal.

__Five miles meandering with a mazy motion__  
__Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,__  
__And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;__  

__And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far__  
__Ancestral voices prophesying war!__  

## Stanza 3
_The shadow of the dome of pleasure_  
_Floated midway on the waves;_  
_Where was heard the mingled measure_  
_From the fountain and the caves._  
_It was a miracle of rare device,_  
_A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!_  

_A damsel with a dulcimer_  
_In a vision once I saw:_  
_It was an Abyssinian maid_  
_And on her dulcimer she played,_  
_Singing of Mount Abora._  
_Could I revive within me_  
_Her symphony and song,_  
_To such a deep delight 'twould win me,_  
_That with music loud and long,_  
_I would build that dome in air,_  
_That sunny dome! those caves of ice!_  
_And all who heard should see them there,_  
_And all should cry, Beware! Beware!_  
_His flashing eyes, his floating hair!_  
_Weave a circle round him thrice,_  
_And close your eyes with holy dread_  
_For he on honey-dew hath fed,_  
_And dunk the milk of Paradise._
