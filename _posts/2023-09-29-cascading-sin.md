Don't forgive the rallying cry.  
It burns into your soul.  
Harmful words. Wanton deeds.  
Summoning you to lie.  
  
Dank catalyst  
Fractured memes of intention.  
Uproarious comments.  
Shards of despair.  
  
Cascading sin.  
Magnifying inner turmoil.  
Awkwardness defines your style.  
A fight you cannot win.
