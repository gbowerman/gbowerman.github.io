Teddy. Graceful cat.  
What is your wish old boy?  
To walk in the garden and bask in the sunlight?  
To snuggle on the bed stretching and purring?  
To curl up with Darcy grooming and snoozing?  
Eating fish, getting high on catnip..  
Forever Teddy. Forever.   

We laid Teddy to rest.  
Beautiful, peaceful, and sad.  
It was time.  
He passed in the garden he likes so much, the love of his family around him.  

Thank you Teddy  
Born wild, with those long legs  
Dressed to the nines  
Loving and loved  
Gentle lion  
Best friend.
