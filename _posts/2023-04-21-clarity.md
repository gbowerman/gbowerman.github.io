Passing from buzziness to clarity of mind.  
Springtime in its ether-essence.  

Embracing words in their arboreal vicissitude.  
Is linguistic expression a viable currency?   
Experiencing hyper-sanity  
Yet easily startled.  

The unmapped meeting the unmapped.  
Add positivity to every encounter.  
Service brings satisfaction, frustration  
And the opportunity to witness life as a participant.  

You're not special.  
You are a participant in a web of life.  
A strand is special.  
A journey is special.  

At the end of a long journey   
Get comfortable and optimize your life.
