Where are the mandarins?  
Glowing with quiet indignance  
In their suffused chambers,  
Withholding platinum dreams  
And casting blank aspersions heavenward.  
Do not intrude upon the workings of men without portfolio.   

A certain lady speaks of regret  
And damns her eyes upon injustice as it unfolds.  
Do not unmask the withered dreams of others.  
Catastrophe awaits.  
Untold and unsold visions of horror.  
Glance against the maelstrom  
That beckons with a Siren's lamentful wail.
