Harken to the lying heart  
And watch it miss a beat.  
Chaos reigns and turmoil starts  
As wretchedness competes.  
Beauty stays for many days  
And then it falls apart.  
  
Henceforth mark your calendars  
The time for mirth is past.  
Arbitrage will come to pass  
The devil's work is fast.  
Empty hallows keep their worth  
And empty hearts are bleak.
