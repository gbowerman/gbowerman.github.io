__What is the reason? So many ask.__  
__Blighted pilgrims, doomed to fail__  
__A bleak and endless eternal task:__  
__The phantom, elusive grail__  

__Morbid meandering,__  
__Morose and mundane.__  
__Endless repetition__  
__Of pathways in vain.__  

__Brutal and futile,__  
__Cruel and unjust.__  
__Fleetingly fatal,__  
__Ending in dust.__  

__The death mask of this labyrinth world,__  
__Lies heavy upon the eyes.__  
__See the paradox, of time unfurled__  
__And breathe, as perception dies.__  

__Capture a moment.__  
__Burn in its length.__  
__Arcing intensely.__  
__Flashing with strength.__  

__Step forward, into the searing light__  
__Embrace the hallowed fire,__  
__In blind defiance of Vulcan's might__  
__Mount the funeral pyre.__  

__Branching fate, I surrender to thee,__  
__And laugh at our path through absurdity.__
