What is the reason? So many ask.  
Blighted pilgrims, doomed to fail  
A bleak and endless eternal task:  
A phantom, elusive grail  

Morbid meandering,  
Morose and mundane.  
Endless repetition  
Of pathways in vain.  

Brutal and futile,  
Cruel and unjust.  
Fleetingly fatal,  
Ending in dust.  

The death mask of this labyrinth world,  
Lies heavy upon the eyes.  
See the paradox, of time unfurled  
And breathe, as perception dies.  

Capture a moment.  
Burn in its length.  
Arcing intensely.  
Flashing with strength.  

Step forward, into the searing light  
Embrace the hallowed fire,  
In blind defiance of Vulcan's might  
Mount the funeral pyre.  

Branching fate, I surrender to thee,  
And laugh at our path through absurdity.
