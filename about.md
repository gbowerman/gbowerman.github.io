Thank you for reading.  

This is a collection of words and thoughts captured at points in my life that seemed significant at the time.

Thank you GitHub pages, Jekyll, and the <a href="https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/BlogBox-Jekyll-Theme/tree/master">BlogBox theme</a> which I more or less left intact.
